# CRISPR Off-Target Prediction with CasOFFinder

This repository provides a Python script for predicting off-target effects of CRISPR-based gene therapy. The script utilizes the CasOFFinder tool to identify potential off-target sites for a given guide RNA sequence. It also incorporates machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cleavage at each off-target site, taking into account features such as chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. The tool is designed to achieve high accuracy and specificity in off-target prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CasOFFinder
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   
   ```shell
   pip install scikit-learn pandas
Obtain the CasOFFinder tool from source and configure it as needed.
Run the main script offtarget_prediction.py to perform off-target prediction:
shell
Copy code
python offtarget_prediction.py
The script will execute the following steps:
Run CasOFFinder to obtain off-target sites for a given guide RNA sequence.
Extract features from the off-target sites, incorporating chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation information.
Train a machine learning model using the extracted features and provided labels.
Evaluate the trained model.
Optionally, benchmark against existing off-target prediction tools (to be implemented).
To use the trained model for predicting off-target effects on new sites, modify and run the test script test_prediction.py:
shell
Copy code
python test_prediction.py
The script will load the trained model and predict the likelihood of off-target cleavage for new off-target sites.
Customization

Modify the feature extraction process in the extract_features function of offtarget_prediction.py script to incorporate additional features as needed from the off-target sites data.
Adjust the machine learning model and its parameters in the train_model function of offtarget_prediction.py script to fit your requirements.
Implement the benchmarking function in the benchmark function of offtarget_prediction.py script to compare the tool's performance against existing off-target prediction tools.
Note

Ensure that CasOFFinder and other required tools are properly installed and configured before running the script.
Provide appropriate guide RNA sequences, off-target site data, and labels to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
